Author: Michail - Panagiotis Bofos AO082689

Note: if you have Python and pyplot installed the program will create its own error/epoch and success/epoch plots, anyhow the requested files will still be created.

*** Files train.txt and test.txt are recreated each time we run the application ***

*** an example set is given in the Results directory ***

For mre information your can read the Report.pdf which explains decision such as the train & test set creation and the parameters used.

Instructions: 

    Windows: 
            1) javac *.java
            2) java Network parameters.txt

    Unix/Linux:
            1) Run runLetters.sh parameters.txt - or - runLetters.sh parameters.txt -C [if you want to clean up the .class files created]
            NOTE: keep in mind to give runLetters.sh script running rights "chmod +x runLetters.sh"
